// today we will discuss about clodinary for file uploading , videos and image uploading 
// there are two steps for uploading the images or files to the cloudinary 
// 1. first we use multer and upload the file in the server 
// 2. from the server we extract the actual path and upload to the cloudinary , 
// 3. after successfully uploading the file we will remove from the server all the files and videos or images 



// now i will explain the how file uploading or other images pdf's are uploaded 



// step 1 :- we use multer to take the videos or the files from the frontend 
// using multer we access the videos , multer is used as the middleware , becoz there are no all the routes , we are uploading there might be only two three routes , for these two three routes , we use to write the multer in the controllers we have to write it for two , three routes instead of it we will it as middleware , and were every required we will inject this middleware
